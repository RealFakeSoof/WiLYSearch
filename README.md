> WiLYSearch is a fork of LibreY, which is a fork of LibreX, a framework-less and javascript-free privacy respecting meta search engine, made by [hnhx](https://github.com/hnhx). LibreY changed some features like automatic redirection, which is carried over in this. The original code is written by [hnhx and contributors](https://github.com/hnhx/LibreX/contributors)

### How to host LibreY

To host LibreY using Docker, you can follow the instructions in the [Docker directory](https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/tree/main/docker).

To host LibreY using your OS's native package manager and PHP+NGINX, you can use the following steps as a guide.

These instructions are specific to Debian GNU/Linux but should be similar on most *nix variants (differences may include commands for package management, init system, php-fpm.sock location and availability of fastcgi-php.conf)

Install the packages (Debian GNU/Linux):

```sh
sudo apt install php php-fpm php-dom php-curl php-apcu nginx git
```

Install the packages (Arch Linux):
```sh
sudo pacman -S php php-fpm php-apcu nginx git
```

Clone LibreY:

```sh
mkdir -p /var/www/html
git clone https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY.git /var/www/html/LibreY
```

Rename the config and opensearch files, edit manually if needed:

```sh
cd /var/www/html/LibreY/
mv config.php.example config.php
mv opensearch.xml.example opensearch.xml
```

Change opensearch.xml to point to your domain:

```sh
sed -i 's/http:\/\/localhost:80/https:\/\/your.domain/g' opensearch.xml
```

An nginx configuration similar to the one below should be placed in your `http { ... }` block or a file that is automatically detected as such.

```sh
server {
        listen 80;

        server_name your.domain;

        root /var/www/html/LibreY;
        index index.php;

        location ~ \.php$ {
               include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
               fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
        }
}
```

You can optionally remove the .php extension in URLs by adding this code your `server { ... }` block.

```sh
location / {
       try_files $uri $uri/ @extensionless-php;
}

location @extensionless-php {
       rewrite ^(.*)$ $1.php last;
}
```

Start php-fpm and nginx immediately and on every boot:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now php-fpm nginx
```

Now LibreY should be running at the port you specified!

### About WiLYSearch

WiLYSearch gives you text results from Google, DuckDuckGo, Brave Search, Ecosia, Yandex Search and Mojeek. WiLYSearch provides images from Qwant, and torrents from i.e. Ahmia and popular torrent sites. WiLYSearch does this without spying on you.
<br>WiLYSearch doesn't save **any** type of data about the user, there are no logs (except NGINX logs if the host sets them).
